SwarmEmu is a Microbee emulator written in Swift/SwiftUI

It is a port of Nanowasp ( www.nanowasp.org ),  a Javascript emulation of a tape based Microbee written by David G. Churchill

The inital aim is to replicate the functionality of Nanowasp in Swift/SwiftUI

And at some point along the way, expand to include other Microbee models and functionality.
And who knows, maybe port it to Windows and Linux

Why ?

To expand my knowledge of modern coding languages and techniques and to revisit my first computing experience
