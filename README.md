SwarmEmu is a SwiftUI/Swift emulator compatible with tape based models of the Microbee computer

Based on Nanowasp ( http://www.nanowasp.org )
Copyright (c) 2007, 2011 David G. Churchill

The inital aim is to replicate the functionality of Nanowasp within Swift/SwiftUI

And at some point along the way, emulate other Microbee models
And who knows, maybe port it to Windows and Linux

Why ?

To expand my knowledge of modern coding languages and techniques and to revisit my first computing experience
