Based on [Nanowasp](http://www.nanowasp.org)

The MicroWorld Basic V5.22e ROM and the MicroBee Font ROM are used in this emulator with kind permission from Ewan J. Wordsworth of [Microbee Technology](https://www.microbeetechnology.com.au/)

The inital aim is to replicate the functionality of Nanowasp within Swift/SwiftUI on MacOS and iOS

And at some point along the way, emulate other Microbee models  
And who knows, maybe port it to Windows and Linux  

Why ?

To expand my knowledge of modern coding languages and techniques and to revisit my first computing experience
